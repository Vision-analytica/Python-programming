# About these notebooks

All these Jupiter notebooks are from courses provided by [Jovian.ml](https://jovian.ai/) and you can get infromation from the course website, [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas). All these Jupiter notebooks were used to do exercise while following the course. There are additional modifications done to the notebooks provided by course instructor as per his suggestions. 

I have also two additional python notebook, with details on

- NUMPY
- google-colab-help.ipynb

I love to run all these codes on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com). Since, I have not used the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or on my local device, I have removed the parts where `import jovian` section was given in the notebooks. I always prefere to run my code either on google colab or on my local system. To run on local system and then upload it to the github, I use git. I have also added a repository to learn fundamentals of git (please see [my git repository](https://github.com/arunsinp/Learning-git)).
