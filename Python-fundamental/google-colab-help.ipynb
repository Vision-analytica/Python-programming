    "## How to upload files to and download files from Google Colab?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a Colab notebook is hosted on Google’s cloud servers, there’s no direct access to files on your local drive (unlike a notebook hosted on your machine) or any other environment by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessing GitHub from Google Colab:**\n",
    "    - **Clone a GitHub repository:** You can clone a GitHub repository into your Colab environment in the same way as you would in your local machine, using git clone. Once the repository is cloned, refresh the file-explorer to browse through its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        !git clone https://github.com/arunsinp/Python-programming.git\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Load individual files directly from GitHub:** In case you just have to work with a few files rather than the entire repository, you can load them directly from GitHub without needing to clone the repository to Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "        To do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - click on the file in the repository, \n",
    "        - click on View Raw,\n",
    "        - copy the URL of the raw file, \n",
    "        - use this URL as the location of your file.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. **Accessing Local File System to Google Colab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can read from or write to your local file system either using the file-explorer, or Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Access local files through the file-explorer\n",
    "    Uploading files from local file system through file-explorer\n",
    "    You can either use the upload option at the top of the file-explorer pane to upload any file(s) from your local file system to Colab in the present working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "    To upload files directly to a subdirectory you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Click on the three dots visible when you hover above the directory \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Select the “upload” option."
