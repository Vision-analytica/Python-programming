Example text highlighted in green background.

Example text highlighted in yellow background.

Example text highlighted in red background.

Format text appropriately:
a). Insert math equation with LaTeX
There is often a need to reference mathematical equations in Notebook documentations. With $, we can use LaTeX to show nicely formatted math formulas:

 
When the equation is wrapped with double  , it will be left-aligned. Alternatively, we can also use this syntax to write the formula:

 
 
Use code-blocks:
A code block in text box is given inside ⇒ code

If you haven't installed textblob, you can install it with: 

`pip install texblob`
Use quote indentation:
Indentation is another way to format text to improve readability. We can add indentation with >:

Sample non-indented sentence here.
> **Note:** Indented text.
Add media:
